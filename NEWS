--------------------------------------------------------

--------------------------------------------------------
- Minor improvements and changes:
  - Replace "Add" and "Remove" buttons with "+" and "-"

- Bug fixes:
  - Cases that were not currently opened, could not be deleted
  - Multi-occurrences view also contained all single-occurrences of
    remedies

v0.11.0  Sun 20 Jun 2021 04:41:09 PM CEST [tag: v0.11.0]
--------------------------------------------------------
- Main features:
  - A "dark theme" for the UI is available

- Minor improvements and changes:
  - Subpages now have their own URL-path (e.g., /faq, /impressum,
    etc.), which is also more SEO-friendly and makes the back-button
    in the browser a lot more useful
  - Switched to bootstrap v4.2.1 (from v4.1.3)
  - Minor build.sbt clean-up (e.g., removed notify.js and old
    jquery 2.2.4 dependencies)

  - Edit-file dialog no longer "cuts off", if there are are many
    cases associated with it

    emptied, if it wasn't empty before

v0.10.0  Fri 30 Apr 2021 08:22:12 PM CEST [tag: v0.10.0]
--------------------------------------------------------
- Main features:
  - Users can now get their username sent to their email address
  - Users can now get a password change request sent to their
    email address
  - Removed all authentication code in favour of using dedicated
    third-party modules instead (right now: SAML 2.0 in the form
    of SimpleSAMLphp as IdP and mod_auth_mellon as SP); that is,
    API endpoints, which are meant to be only used by logged in
    users, now start with /api/sec/ (where /sec/ needs to be
    protected by the SP) rather than just /api/ alone

- Minor improvements and changes:
  - Rudimentary beginnings of a system test suite under /test

- Bug fixes:
  - Unsuccessful lookup no longer throws exception in the background
    (bug introduced in v0.9.0)
  - Empty descriptions of files could not be altered or subsequently
    saved (bug introduced in v0.9.0)

v0.9.0  Sun 14 Mar 2021 05:58:57 PM CET [tag: v0.9.0]
-----------------------------------------------------
- Main features:
  - Sane site view when JavaScript is disabled (required introduction
    of a lot of new API endpoints)
  - HTML5-compliance on all pages (where I managed to check it; i.e.
    that are rather static rather than dynamic)
  - Clicking on "Remedies" now toggles display of remedy name format
    (instead of displaying remedy weights as numerals)

- Minor improvements and changes:
  - Display 0-valued remedies in brackets (e.g., bogboen)
  - Show small repertories, such as tylercold, always in full,
    irrespective of user input
  - More verbose repertory descriptions in pull-down menus (also
    required a database schema change)
  - Optimise transmission of available repertories and remedies on
    start-up for faster site loading
  - Remove code to import repertories from JSON representation as this
    is no longer used (Instead, there is now an SQL dump of a
    PostgreSQL database in the git repository that contains both GPL'ed
    repositories publicum and kent-de. This also removes the need for
    defining $OOREP_REP_PATH and $OOREP_IMPORT_REPERTORIES)
  - The looking up of a user's cases no longer opens a separate
    database connection, but also uses connection pool, which makes
    this operation also considerably faster

v0.8.1  Sun 31 Jan 2021 10:30:54 AM CET [tag: v0.8.1]
-----------------------------------------------------
- A less "in your face" cookie-consent dialog
- Remove landing page (and other) time consuming redirects

v0.8.0  Tue 26 Jan 2021 10:20:10 AM CET [tag: v0.8.0]
-----------------------------------------------------
- Main features (that made API changes necessary):
  - Repertorisation results can be shared via copy+paste of a link
  - Site should look much better on smaller screen sizes

- Minor improvements and changes:
  - A loading spinner is presented if web site start up takes time
  - A warning page is presented if JavaScript is not enabled
  - Backend rejects API-calls with very short inputs (to prevent
    data leeching)

- Bug fixes:
  - Redo button would not always show last remedy and last weight

v0.7.0  Wed 04 Nov 2020 04:38:26 PM CET [tag: v0.7.0]
-----------------------------------------------------
- Introduce results page cache in client code to put less strain on the
  backend, and to speed up browsing back and forth through the search
  results
- Remove a superfluous API call to available_remedies, when those are,
  in fact, already in the cache

v0.6.1  Fri 30 Oct 2020 03:47:11 PM CET [tag: v0.6.1]
-----------------------------------------------------
- Show multi-occurrences of remedies for entire search rather than for
  current page only
- Display full remedy names when hovering with mouse over remedy
  abbreviations in the repertorisation view
- Differentiate 5-valued from 4-valued remedies by double underlining
  (cf. bogboen)
- Introduced env-var OOREP_IMPORT_REPERTORIES to trigger import of raw
  repertory data upon program start-up from JSON-files (to avoid accidental
  deletion of repertory changes)

v0.6.0  Thu 01 Oct 2020 07:57:26 PM CEST [tag: v0.6.0]
------------------------------------------------------
- Main features (that made API and schema changes necessary):
  - Search can now be restricted to a specific remedy and/or a minimal
    remedy weight
  - Pagination of search results to show ALL rubrics of a search (as
    opposed to only the first 130 as before)
  - Changed DB-type of file description from varchar(2048) to text

- Minor improvements and changes:
  - Reduced number of displayable rubrics per page from 130 to 100
    (which is OK, since we have pagination now - no rubric is lost!)
  - Multiple occurrences of rubrics on top of results page are now
    collapsable
  - "High number of search results"-alert is now disposable
  - Replaced the rather useless "clear search terms"-button with
    "Toggle advanced search parameters"-button

- Bug fixes:
  - Some existing rubrics of repertories publicum, bogboen and kent-de
    wouldn't show up in results earlier
  - Various minor corrections in the presentation of results and
    suggestions of alternative search terms

v0.5.0  Sun 02 Aug 2020 11:10:51 AM CEST [tag: v0.5.0]
------------------------------------------------------
- Upgraded program to ScalaJS 1.1 and Play 2.8 (and other dependencies
  accordingly)

v0.4.0  Sun 02 Aug 2020 10:22:18 AM CEST [tag: v0.4.0]
------------------------------------------------------
- Empty rubrics are now added to the search results (but cannot be added
  to a case, of course)
- Added possibility to attach simple single-character labels to case rubrics
  (so that different forms of repertorisation can be applied)
- Repertorisation view now supports sorting
- Modal dialogs now display files sorted

v0.3.2  Sun 16 Feb 2020 09:02:50 AM CET [tag: v0.3.2]
-----------------------------------------------------
- Don't suggest very short or non-alphanumeric short terms in helpful
  messages when none or too many results are found
- Logout user automatically if stale cookie was detected (as it may
  happen, if the user logged in from two different machines without
  logging out in between)
- Remove deprecated method of Repertory() as it was no longer used
- An attempt at helpful message when lookup yields too many results
- Limit enterable search terms to at most 20 and length of 200 characters
- Fix labelling of "redo search button" at top of page 
- Fix Facebook-preview picture

v0.3.1  Sat 08 Feb 2020 11:07:33 AM CET [tag: v0.3.1]
-----------------------------------------------------
- An attempt at more helpful error messages when repertory lookup failed
- Changed default for remedy display: formatted as opposed to explicit weights
- Bug fix: if initial case was too large, it couldn't be added to a file
- Bug fix: if a search was unsuccessful, a subsequent search would not remove
  the error message, if the results were the same as the last successful search

v0.3.0  Sun 02 Feb 2020 01:17:05 PM CET [tag: v0.3.0]
-----------------------------------------------------
- Bug fix: available_reps wasn't called when drop-down was empty
- Pulled out some REST Post-requests to Put and Delete to be more compliant
- Added repertories publicum and kent-de to repository
- Removed third-party JavaScript-libraries from repository due to (potential)
  licensing issues (need to be downloaded and pre-installed before build now)

-----------------------------------------------------
- Removed superfluous REST-API calls to available_reps

-----------------------------------------------------
- Check authorisation for authenticated users in API calls
- All REST-API calls now have a preceding /api/ in their paths
