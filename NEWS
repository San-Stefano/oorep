v0.6.0  under development
------------------------------------------------------
- Main features (that made API and schema changes necessary):
  - Search can now be restricted to a specific remedy and/or a minimal
    remedy weight
  - Pagination of search results to show ALL rubrics of a search (as
    opposed to only the first 130 as before)
  - Changed DB-type of file description from varchar(2048) to text

- Minor improvements and changes:
  - Removed atama-repertory as it was merely a subset of publicum and
    kent
  - Reduced number of displayable rubrics per page from 130 to 100
    (which is OK, since we have pagination now - no rubric is lost!)
  - Multiple occurrences of rubrics on top of results page are now
    collapsable
  - "High number of search results"-alert is now disposable
  - Replaced the rather useless "clear search terms"-button with
    "Toggle advanced search parameters"-button

- Bug fixes:
  - Some existing rubrics of repertories publicum, bogboen and kent-de
    wouldn't show up in results earlier
  - Various minor corrections in the presentation of results and
    suggestions of alternative search terms
