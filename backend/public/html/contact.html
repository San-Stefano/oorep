      OOREP is free software and was written
      by <a href="http://baueran.multics.org/">Andreas Bauer</a>.  I,
      Andreas Bauer, also run and maintain this server, which hosts
      an installed instance of OOREP for your convenience; that is, it
      saves you from setting up an OOREP instance on your own.
