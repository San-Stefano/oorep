    <h5 class="freetext">What is OOREP?</h5>

    <p style="text-align:justify;">
		OOREP is an open online homeopathic repertorisation system, in
		that it is open source software and only requires a web
		browser to run.
    </p>
      
    <p style="text-align:justify;">
		That is, if you don't like this web page, or would like to
		change something in the program, you can download its source
		code, edit it, compile it and run your own server.  If you
		don't know how to do that, feel free to use this very server
		that you are on, which we have provided for your convenience.
    </p>
      
    <p style="text-align:justify;">
		OOREP was written primarily for people who are familiar with
		the term (homeopathic) repertorisation, such as professionals
		or students of homeopathy, but also and in particular for interested
		laypersons with merely a personal interest in homeopathy (like
		the author of this software).  It is not, however, a
		(professional) medicinal software for storing any kind of
		sensitive patient data or for obtaining	medical analyses of any
		sorts.  <b>Consider OOREP as a training and exploratory tool
		only!</b>  It is not intended to and cannot replace the visit
		of a doctor/GP or in case of an illness.  See also the disclaimer
		at the bottom of this page!
    </p>

    <h5 class="freetext">What is repertorisation?</h5>
      
    <p style="text-align:justify;">
		Loosely speaking, repertorisation is the process of looking up
		categories in homeopathic repertory books.  These books have
		been around for almost as long as homeopathy itself and are
		intended to help homeopathic practitioners select homeopathic
		remedies.  Online or in general software-based repertorisation
		aims at automating this look-up process so as to be more
		efficient.  It does, however, not provide any information or
		recommendations, which the underlying sources (i.e., the
		homeopathic repertory books) don't provide.  So, in abstract
		terms you can think of repertorisation as the electronic
		searching in homeopathy books.
    </p>

    <h5 class="freetext">Why yet another homeopathic software?</h5>
      
    <p style="text-align:justify;">
		There are indeed very good and mature homeopathy programs out
		there whose features exceed those offered by OOREP by far.
		However, these all suffer from one or both of the following
		problems: 1. they are extremely expensive (especially, if you
		like the author of OOREP do not make a living from a
		homeopathic practice), and 2. they are platform-specific;
		meaning, they require a certain version of an operating system
		and/or a license key to be installed on a specific computer,
		etc., which can be a practical challenge or at least an
		inconvenience. (For example, what if you update your computer
		or buy a new one?)
    </p>
      
    <p style="text-align:justify;">
		OOREP was written to be easily accessible by anybody with an
		interest in and basic understanding of homeopathy.  As such it
		doesn't offer the same advanced features that the commercial
		homeopathy programs do.  Assisted repertorisation, however,
		which is <emph>the</emph> key feature of any such homeopathy
		program, is offered, even including multiple different
		repertories.

    <h5 class="freetext">Who wrote OOREP?</h5>

	<p style="text-align:justify;">
	OOREP was written by Andreas Bauer (see also contact
	section at the bottom of this site or impressum for
	German-speaking users) in his copious spare time.
	
	It is based on a lot of other open source software such as
	Scala, Scala.Js, Play, PostgreSQL and others, and its source
	code can be freely obtained from its git repository.  Its
	source code is published under the so-called GNU General
	Public License (short: GPL) and as such, OOREP comes with no
	warranty, no guarantees, not even fitness for a particular
	purpose.
    </p>

    <h5 class="freetext">What repertories do you use?</h5>

    <p style="text-align:justify;">
		At the moment, there are seven different repertories installed
		on this server.  We do <b>not</b> consider them to be part of
		OOREP itself though.  Until further notice, the OOREP source
		code is only accompanied by the <i>kent-de</i> repertory (see
		list below).  The other repertories are served on this very
		server for your convenience, but are presently not intended
		for any further redistribution.
    </p>

    <p style="text-align:justify;">
		The following repertories are currently used on this server:
    </p>

    <ul>
	<li>atama: repertory of the AtamA software (derived from
	  <i>kent</i>). Copyright <b>Anahata Software</b>. Used with
	  friendly permission from Paul Dupuy, Jr. from Feb. 9.,
	  2019.</li>

	    materia medica</i> (ca. 1891).</li>

          Bildungswerk für therapeutische Berufe/<b>Joscha
            Körschgen</b>. Published under the terms of the GNU GPL v3
          license as part of a
          "<a href="https://github.com/Bergische-Akademie/OpenRep-Deutsch">fork</a>"
          of Vladimir Polony's OpenRep software (2012).</li>
	
	<li>publicum: repertory v0.9 of the OpenRep software (derived
	  from <i>kent</i>). Published by <b>Vladimir Polony</b>,
	  Stupy 24, Banska Bystrica, Slovakia under the terms of the
	  GNU GPL v3 license (2008).</li>
    </ul>

    <p style="text-align:justify;">
	Unless otherwise noted, the repertories were extracted
	from publicly available sources from the Internet, e.g.,
	scans, PDFs, etc.  We do not hold responsibility for any errors
	that may have occurred in the process.  If you do happen
	to find any such error and report it to us, we will,
	however, attempt to correct it as soon as possible.
    </p>

    <p style="text-align:justify;">
	Please also note that the availability of certain repertories
	is likely to change in the future.  There will always be one
	or two repertories free to use for anybody who wishes to, but
	we have plans to make certain features and repertories
	available only to those, who register with this web
	site. When/if this will happen, we cannot foresee right now.
    </p>
      
    <h5 class="freetext">Any plans to offer the modern/big repertories like Synthesis or Murphy?</h5>

    <p style="text-align:justify;">
	Yes, we'd love to.  For example, we have even spoken to Roger
	Zandvoort at some point about the inclusion of his repertory,
	but due to the limited amount of time we can invest in OOREP
	right now, we have no concrete plans when/if this will happen.

    <h5 class="freetext">Why am I not getting the desired results from repertorisation?</h5>

    <p style="text-align:justify;">
	There are two major reasons, why you may be dissatisifed with
	the search results of this site:
    </p>

    <p style="text-align:justify;">
		1. the search is currently limited to max. 130 results per
		single look-up.  If you get this number of results, you can try
		restricting your search by adding additional search terms.
		For efficiency reasons, we have currently no plans of returning
		more than 130 results per look-up. Alternatively, you can exclude
		certain search terms to make your search more specific. So, for
		example, rather than looking for "pain", you could look for "pain,
		-abdomen, -head", thereby excluding all results containing "head"
		or "abdomen".
    </p>

    <p style="text-align:justify;">
		2. the search doesn't return <i>enough</i> results for a
		single look-up.  In this case, try using
		so-called <b>wildcards</b>.  So, instead of looking for
		"throat, dry" (2 results in publicum), you could try looking
		for "throat*, dry*" (47 results in publicum).  This also
		matches "dryness", for example.
    </p>
      
    <h5 class="freetext">How does registration/login work?</h5>
      
    <p style="text-align:justify;">
		As the above answers already indicate, what you see here is an
		early preview of OOREP.  Registration is currently disabled in
		this phase and login only possible for selected beta-testers,
		so to speak.  How long this phase will last, we cannot foresee
		right now.
    </p>
      
    <h5 class="freetext">How much does OOREP cost?</h5>
      
    <p style="text-align:justify;">
	OOREP is free and always will be!  However, there will be a
	paid service subscription model on this web site, which you
	may or may not want to use in the future.  See also the
	pricing section on this site (see top of page).
    </p>
      
    <h5 class="freetext">Do you have a cookie and privacy policy?</h5>

    <p style="text-align:justify;">
	Yes, please see the policy link at the bottom of this site.
    </p>
      
    <h5 class="freetext">Who do I contact and where may I get support from?</h5>
      
    <p style="text-align:justify;">
		Please see the contact link at the bottom of this site.
		However, we basically offer no help in using or explaining
		this web site.  We simply do not have the time to do so.
		Any other issues which you may have with OOREP or this
		site, can be forwarded to us.
