        <h3>What is OOREP?</h3>
        <p>
            OOREP is an open online homeopathic repertorisation system, in that it is open source
            software and only requires a web browser to run.
        </p>

        <p>
            That is, if you don't like this web page, or would like to change something in the program, you
            can download its source code, edit it, compile it and run your own server.  If you don't know how
            to do that, feel free to use this very server that you are on, which I have provided for your
            convenience.
        </p>

        <p>
            OOREP was written primarily for people who are familiar with the term (homeopathic) repertorisation,
            such as professionals or students of homeopathy, but also interested laypersons like myself.  It is
            not, however, a (professional) medicinal software for storing any kind of patient data or for
            obtaining medical analysis of any sorts!  <b>Consider OOREP as a training tool only!</b>  It is not
            a medical recommendation or treatment tool or intended to replace the visit of a doctor or the like.
            See also the disclaimer at the bottom of this page.

    <div class="row">
        <h3>What is repertorisation?</h3>

        <p>
            Loosely speaking, repertorisation is the process of looking up categories in homeopathic repertory
            books.  These books have been around almost as long as homeopathy itself and are intended to help
            homeopathic practitioners finding homeopathic remedies.  Online or software-based repertorisation
            aims at automating this look-up process so as to be more efficient.  It does, however, not provide
            any information or recommendations, which the underlying sources (i.e., the homeopathic repertory
            books) don't provide.
        </p>
    </div>

    <div class="row">
        <h3>Why yet another homeopathic software?</h3>

        <p>
            There are indeed very good and mature homeopathic programs out there which exceed OOREP by far.  However,
            these all suffer from one or both of the following problems: 1. they are extremely expensive (especially,
            if you like me do not make a living from homeopathic repertorisation), and 2. they are platform-specific,
            meaning, they require a certain version of operating system and/or require the license key to be installed
            on a specific machine, etc., which can be a practical challenge or at least inconvenience.
        </p>

        <p>
            OOREP was written to be easily accessible by anybody with an interest in and understanding of homeopathy.
            As such it doesn't offer the same advanced features that the commercial homeopathy programs do.
            Assisted or automated repertorisation, however, which is the key feature of any such homeopathy program,
            is offered, even including multiple repertories.
        </p>

        <p>
            The repertories, however, are not all offered for free - partly due to intellectual property reasons,
            partly because I intend to offer additional services around OOREP later on - which will, however, not
            affect this free-to-use installation of OOREP.  The commercial services are intended to help me pay for
            server rental, etc.  See also the pricing section on this server for more information regarding this
            topic.

        <h3>Who wrote OOREP?</h3>
    </div>

    <div class="row">
        <p>
            OOREP was written by <a href="http://baueran.multics.org/">Andreas Bauer</a> (see also contacts section
            at the bottom of this site) in his copious spare time.  It is written using Scala.Js, Play, and PostgreSQL and its
            source code can be freely obtained from its git repository.  It is published under the GNU General Public
            License and comes with no warranty, no guarantees, not even fitness for a particular purpose.
        </p>
    </div>

    <div class="row">
        <h3>What repertories do you use?</h3>
    </div>

    <div class="row">
        <p>
            Right now, I serve on this very server 7 different repertories, including Kent's and Hering's.  However,
            these are not part of OOREP itself, but merely of this installation of it.  OOREP runs fine with only
            those repertories that are hosted in its git repository.  Moreover, everyone with technical expertise
            can add their own repositories, run their own OOREP installation sites and charge for this very service -
            so long as OOREPs source code and potential changes to it remain publicly available under the GNU
            General Publice license.
        </p>

        <p>
            As such, I also reserve the right to not publish some of my repertories via OOREP's git repository and
            to offer access to them
            only for a small service fee, which is to be determined.  The fee is intended to help me cover the costs
            of offering and maintaining this free site to the public.
        </p>

        <p>
            To those, who do not want to pay a service fee, there will always be access to the reduced set of
            repertories, which can also be downloaded via OOREP's git repository.
        </p>

        <p>
            The respective repertory information can be obtained via the repertory menu.  Note that not all of them
            are free or copyright-less (like Kent's or Hering's), which is another reason why I cannot provide them
            for download.  All repertories, however, free or not, have been used either with friendly permission,
            under a public license, or been obtained from manual conversion from public sources such as historic book
            scans.
        </p>
        <p>
            As an example: it took me two weeks full-time work to extract Hering's repertory from online resources.  And
            while Hering's repertory is copyright-free, I have right now no plans of publishing the transcribed information
            on the git repository.  Please check the git repository yourself, in order to find out which repertories are
            accompanied by OOREPs source and which are only available to be used on this very site.

        <h3>Any plans to offer the modern/big repertories like Synthesis or Murphy?</h3>
    </div>

    <div class="row">
        <p>
            Yes, I'd love to.  I have spoken to Roger Zandvoort at some point about it, but due to the limited
            amount of time I can invest in OOREP, I have no concrete plans as of yet.

        As the above answers already indicate, what you see here is an early-preview of OOREP.  Registration is currently disabled in this phase
        and login only possible for selected beta-testers, so to speak.  Sorry, for the inconvenience.

        OOREP is free and always will be!  However, there will be a paid service subscription model on this web site, which you
        may or may not use in the future.  See also the pricing section on this site.
