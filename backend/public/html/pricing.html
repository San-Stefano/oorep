        <p>
            OOREP is free software (for details, see also the FAQ) and as such, everyone can check out its git
            repository, run or modify the code.
        </p>

        <p>
            However, I have decided to offer a subscription service with OOREP in the future, which lets users access
            further repertories that I am not currently offering on git.  Also, the subscription service is not for
            using the software - it is free, afterall - but for using the software installation on this very server.
        </p>

        <p>
            Renting the server and maintaining it is extra work, and I intend to compensate this a little with a paid
            subscription service.
        </p>

        <p>
            How this will look in detail and what additional services I can offer to subscribers, I cannot tell right now.
            I am developing this in my copious spare time and things take time.
            So, stay tuned!
