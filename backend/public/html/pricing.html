      OOREP is <b>free</b> software (for details, see also the FAQ)
      and as such, everyone can check out its git repository, run or
      modify the code (so long as published modifications employ the
      same GPL license that OOREP does).  That means, you do not have
      to pay in order to use OOREP or this web site.
    </p>
    
    <p style="text-align:justify;">
      However, I have decided to offer a subscription service with
      OOREP in the future, which lets users access further repertories
      that I am not currently offering on this web site or on the git
      repository.  (The repertories hosted on this site are <b>not</b>
      all considered part of the OOREP software; for details, again,
      see the FAQ)! The subscription fee will not have to be paid for
      using the OOREP software - it is free afterall - but for using
      the software installation on this very server with additional
      repertories and features that will require the registration and
      log in of users.  Stay tuned for updates!
    </p>
    
    <p style="text-align:justify;">
      As for the rationale: Renting the server, paying for a domain,
      an SSL certificate and maintaining it is extra work besides the
      programming, and I intend to compensate this a little with the
      paid subscription service in the future.
    </p>
    
    <p style="text-align:justify;">
      How this subscription service will look in detail and what
      additional features I can offer to subscribers, I cannot tell
      right now.  I am developing this in my copious spare time and
      things take time.
