    <p style="text-align:justify;">
      We are pleased about your interest in our web site. The
      protection of your privacy is important to us.  In the
      following, we will inform you in detail about how we are
      handling your data.
    </p>
    
    <h4>Storing of access logs</h4>

    <p style="text-align:justify;">
      You can visit our web site without giving out any personal data.
      We are merely storing access meta data in so-called server
      logfiles, like for example the name of a requested file on the
      server, the date or time of this request as well the amount of
      data transmitted and the Internet provider the request
      originated from.  This data will only be used to uphold the
      technical availability of this server as well as to improve the
      level of service in general.  However, the data is <b>not</b> of
      a nature that it would enable us to deduce or withdraw any
      personal information from it, like who you are, what your name
      is, where you live, etc.
    </p>
    
    <h4>Use of cookies</h4>

    <p style="text-align:justify;">
      In order to make your visit to our web site a pleasant one and
      to offer certain features on it, we are using so-called cookies.
      These are little text files, which will be saved on your
      computer.  Some of these cookies will be deleted after you close
      your web browser (so-called session cookies).  Others remain on
      your computer and enable us to recognise your browser next time
      you visit this site.  You can configure your browser in such a
      way that you will be either informed about cookies that are to
      be stored on your computer, or disable their storing completely.
      In the latter case, however, certain features on this web site
      might not work as intended.
    </p>
    
    <h4>SSL encryption</h4>

    <p style="text-align:justify;">
      In order to protect the integrity of your data in transmission,
      we are using state-of-practice data encryption techniques (e.g.,
      SSL) over HTTPS.
    </p>
    
    <h4>Change of our privacy policy</h4>

    <p style="text-align:justify;">
      We reserve the right to adjust this privacy policy so that it
      always satisfies and adheres to current legal requirements or to
      reflect changes in our service offering.  For your renewed visit
      a then new privacy policy may apply.
    </p>
    
    <h4>Request stored data and possibilities for contact</h4>

    <p style="text-align:justify;">
      According to European law, you are entitled to request personal
      data, belonging to you as a person, which is stored on this web
      site.  Moreover, you have the right to request correction or
      deletion of such data.  In case of questions about how such data
      may be collected or how it can be deleted, or in case you wish
      to withdraw consent for collection of personal data, please
