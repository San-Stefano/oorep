    <p style="text-align:justify;">
      We are pleased about your interest in our web site. The
      protection of your privacy is important to us.  In the
      following, we will inform you in detail about how we are
      handling your data.
    </p>
    
    <h3 class="freetext">Storing of access logs on the server</h3>

    <p style="text-align:justify;">
      You can visit our web site without giving out any personal data.
      We are merely storing access meta data in so-called server
      logfiles.  These are:
    </p>

    <ul>
      <li>Type and version of browser</li>
      <li>Type of operating system</li>
      <li>Referrer URL</li>
      <li>Requested URL</li>
      <li>Hostname of the requesting computer</li>
      <li>Time of day at request</li>
    </ul>

    <p style="text-align:justify;">
      This information by itself can not be used to identify a particular
      person.  There is also no combination of this information with other
      sources of data.  This data is used, if we have reasons to believe
      that our services are being misused in an unlawful manner.  After four
      weeks, the collected data is automatically deleted from our servers.
    </p>
    
    <h3 class="freetext">Use of cookies</h3>

    <p style="text-align:justify;">
      This web site employs three different categories of so-called
      cookies; that is, small text files, which will be saved in your
      browsing device.  Some of the employed cookies will
      automatically be deleted after you close your browser (so-called
      session cookies).  Others remain on your device and enable us to
      recognise it on your next visit of this web site (so-called
      persistent cookies).  You can configure your browser in a way
      that you are being alerted about the transmission of cookies, or
      deny their transmission entirely.
    </p>
    
    <p style="text-align:justify;">
      <b>Cookie category 1: session cookie</b>; to be able to
      differentiate the concurrently operating users and browsers from
      one another.  Does not contain any personal data and can in
      itself not be used to deduce the identity of the user.  This
      category of a cookie can be suppressed by the user's browser,
      but is required by the web site to provide the basic
      functionality.  Hence, there is currently no possibility or
      option to not transmit this category of a cookie.
    </p>

    <p style="text-align:justify;">
      <b>Cookie category 2: security cookie (persistent)</b>; to
      security-harden the web site, such that potential attackers are
      barred from using the web site without the user's consent and
      knowing. Does not contain any personal data and can in itself
      not be used to deduce the identity of the user.  This category
      of a cookie can be suppressed by the user's browser, but is
      required by the web site to provide the basic functionality.
      Hence, there is currently no possibility or option to not
      transmit this category of a cookie.
    </p>
    
    <p style="text-align:justify;">
      <b>Cookie category 3: login cookie (persistent)</b>; will only
      be transmitted after the user has registered with this web site
      and logged in using his personal username and password. This
      category of a cookie contains the internal user ID, and,
      assuming access to the internal database, could then in theory
      be used to deduce the identity of the user.  However, there is
      active protection against this in place in terms of firewalls
      and other security features.  This cookie is irrelevant or
      rather: will not be transmitted, unless the user logs in using
      personalised username and password.  The basic functionality of
      the web site is given even without transmission and use of this
      category of cookie.
    </p>

    <h3 class="freetext">Third-party software, tracker, external fonts and advertisements</h3>

    <p style="text-align:justify;">
      This web site currently uses no external analytics software
      (e.g., Google Analytics), so-called trackers, external fonts
      (e.g., Google Fonts). Furthermore, there are no external
      advertisements included in this web site.  That is, it is not
      possible that any third-party cookies will be transmitted to the
      user's browsing device by using this web site.
    </p>

    <h3 class="freetext">
      Automated decision making and profiling
    </h3>

    <p style="text-align:justify;">
      This web site does not employ any automated processes to make decisions on your behalf
      (including profiling), which are legally binding for you or constrain you in such a
      manner.
    </p>

    <h3 class="freetext">SSL encryption</h3>

    <p style="text-align:justify;">
      In order to protect the integrity of your data in transmission,
      we are using state-of-practice data encryption techniques (e.g.,
      SSL) over HTTPS.
    </p>
